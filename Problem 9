so, here we are again. I'm finding I'm able to get through most of the code, and there's usually a little tid bit I'll have
to think about pretty hard. a Pythagorean triplet is defined by two condition: a<b<c. && a^2+b^2=c^2.

we know the the input(num)=== a + b + c; after after writing the first two loops for a and b(which if we can say
a and b half to be around less than half of the input, no reason to write the loop for c, because that's just the difference of
num-a-b=c. Our two conditions while looping through the set of digits, if the first condition is met (false), continue looping.
once the first condition is met, the second condition test if true for a^2+b^2=c^2, if so, add those digits into an array. 
then a simple for(in) loop can multiply the digits in the arr. after all the for loops and everything is closed,
just before the final bracket we want the function to return the product (var result);


function findPyth(num){
    var arr = [];
    for(var a = 1; a<num/2; a++){
        for(var b = a; b<num/2; b++){
            var c = num - b - a;
            var aSquared = Math.pow(a, 2);
            var bSquared = Math.pow(b, 2);
            var cSquared = Math.pow(c, 2);
            if (! ((c > b)  && (a < b)) ){
                continue;
            }else if((aSquared + bSquared) === cSquared){
                var arr = [a, b, c];
            }
        }
    }
    var result = 1;
    for(var i in arr){
        result *= arr[i];
    }
    return result;
}

findPyth(1000);
