testing |x| in #'s between (1..num-1) (1-number not including number)
if |x| == true that it's a multiple (divides evenly with remainder of 0)
add value of x to the total. after the loop is closed, return the total of all multiples. Run the function

def sum_of_multiples(num)
    total = 0 
    (1..num-1).each do |x|
        if (x%3==0) ||(x%5==0)
            total += x
        end
    end
    return total
end

sum_of_multiples(1000)
