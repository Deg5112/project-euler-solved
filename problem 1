testing |x| in #'s between (1..num-1) (1-number not including number)
if |x| == true that it's a multiple (divides evenly with remainder of 0)
add value of x to the total. after the loop is closed, return the total of all multiples. Run the function

function sum_of_multiples(num){
    var total = 0
    for(var x = 1; x<num;x++){
        if(x%3==0||x%5==0){
            total += x;
        }
    }
    return total;
}

sum_of_multiples(1000);
=> 233168
